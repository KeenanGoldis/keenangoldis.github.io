        <h3>Is Bacon Grease the New Coconut Oil?</h3>
        <p>According the Beyonce, the secret to wonderous and beautiful skin is to rub on bacon grease after showering. This causes the pores to absorb that beautiful meaty flavor that Jay-Z craves. She says that it also has caused her dog to become more effectionate with her.   </p>

        <p>Using bacon grease as a moisturizer is controversial, however. Nas was quoted this week as saying: "It is completely ridiculous to use perfectly good bacon grease as moisturizer when you could use it for such better causes, like frying eggs, veggies, or making a roux!" <p>

        <p>Jay-Z responded by saying:"I got so much bacon grease, I'm not even keeping track of it anymore! Maybe Nas aught to try some bacon grease so he won't smell like stupid coconuts all the time."<p>
