            <h3>CAO Pilon</h3>
            <p> Since I was 14, my go-to cigar was always CAO Brazilia. Since having tried the CAO Pillon just a few weeks ago, I do believe I may have found a new go-to cigar.</p>
            <p>The Pillon has a much lighter flavor than the Brazilia, and draws quite easily. It goes great with a whiskey cocktail. </p>

            <h3>Why the Next Fancy Dinner I have is Going to be at a Steakhouse</h3>
            <p>As a pretentious sausage maker, I've always been a strong believer in taking the unique cuisines from ethnicities around the world, and then bastardizing them by trying to turn them into a sausage. I also like fusion in general, even if other restaurants don't bastardize the cuisines as much as I used to. When it comes to fine-dining fusion, I think I'm ready to call it quits.</p>
            <p>I've noticed a recurring theme in Austin. Every new restaurant seems to have an expensive "small plates" menu. This can be a fun change of pace for two reasons: you get to try lots of different food and it elongates the meal because you can keep ordering round after round. My gripe is that so often you spend a ton of money, yet aren't that full when you leave. Additionally, so often I can't seem to remember any one dish that was great because it was either too small to really savor or the chef was too focused on making being creative that he makes a dish that just doesn't taste as good as old classics.</p>
            <p>The next time I go out for a special occasion I'm going to a steakhouse! They will serve me ONE appetizer entree, ONE expensive entree, and ONE expensive dessert. When I find something the menu item that I LOVE, I don't want to have to share it and wind up only eating several bites of it, and then try 4-7 lesser menu items. I want to order what I want and eat the same thing for fifthteen minutes. </p>
            <p>The second reason I want to go to a steakhouse is for formal service! I'm not crazy about this whole new-age mentality where the service is super hip (and often a bit arrogant) and casual, yet the prices are still high! If I'm going to pay a lot of money, I might as well be treated with respect. I may be an oaf, but that doesn't mean that I'm not still pretentious.</p>
            <p>The final, and maybe most important, reason that I'll be taking my lady to a steakhouse: I want to be disgustingly full when I leave. Steakhouses don't mess around. I want (minimum) 12oz of steak, mashed potato, and some other heavy side like mac and cheese. Heck, I'd even eat some veggies as long as the rest if buttery and filling.</p>
            <p>And you know what, that steak and potatoes is going to taste a whole lot better than 90% of the delicate little "small plates" that you'd order at the new-age restaurants</p>
