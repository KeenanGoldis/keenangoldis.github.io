            <h3>About Me</h3>

            <p>Ever since I was a young boy growing up in Southern Rhode Island, I always knew that I loved eating animals. After moving to Austin after high school, I soon discovered the glory of smoked meats at
                <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/kreuz-market-lockhart" target="_blank">Kruez Market</a>. This would equally raise my chlorestoral, body weight, and ambition.
            </p>

            <p>After graduating from college, I decided to follow my passion for smoked meats by teaching myself how to grill and smoke meat. Evenutally I started making sausages at my apartment, and realized just how delicious a hand-crafted sausage could
                be. That's when I decided to open up
                <a href="http://brisketman.com/goldis-sausage-co/" target="_blank">Goldis Sausage Company</a>.
            </p>

            <p> For two years I had a lot of fun making sausages flavors like Green Curry, Mac and Cheese Sausage, Apple Pie Sausage, Gumbo Sausage, and many more!
            </p>

            <p> Eventually I realized that working 70-100 hours per week every week was a bit much, and I decided to shut down Austin's most pretentious sausage trailer in order to learn some new skills.
            </p>

            <p> In the future I plan to start a web-series about pretentious sausage flavors!

                <h3>Why I am Learning How to Code</h3>
                <p>I am learning to code because I would like to have the ability to create a software or web-based business. My goal is to work hard over the next 5-10 years so that if I ever choose to open a technology-driven business, I will have the
                    competency to create one.
